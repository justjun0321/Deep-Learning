Deep Learning - Neural Network

* Image Classifier Project.ipynb is training a neural network for recognizing images of different species of flowers
* train.py is applying simple deep learning for user to use command line simply input dataset and assigning archtecture for neural network
* predict.py enables users to feed image to the model and get prediction of the species flower
